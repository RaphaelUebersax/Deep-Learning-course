# Deep-Learning-course
This repository contains 2 coding projects perfromed for the Deep Learning course given at EPFL. The first project aims at comparing typical Deep Learning architecture using PyTorch on a rather simple classification task whereas the second focuses on the coding of a mini deep-learning-framework using Python.
